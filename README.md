# MAsP, R Shiny-based web application

Micro-scaffold Assisted Spatial Proteomics (MASP) is a novel method for spatial proteomic studies. MASP precisely procures spatial information by precise tissue spatial compartmentalization using a 3D-printed micro-scaffold, and accurately/sensitively quantifies thousands of proteins in a whole-tissue slice.

MAsP is a R Shiny-based interactive application designed for processing, visualization and analysis of quantitative proteomics data generated by MASP.

## MAsP Installation (less than 5 minutes)
R (Version 4.0.5 or above) is required for Windows 10 or MacOS.

Users can install MAsP with the following line in R:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("JunQu-Lab/MAsP")
```
## Troubleshooting
- R will occasionally ask users whether they want to update any dependent packages that have a new version. We recommend that you update them all.
- Rtools is also required to install R packages.
- During the installation of dependent packages, sometimes R would inquire, "Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compliation?" If users select "Yes" and receive an error, selecting "No" is equally acceptable.

## Run MAsP
If no error pops up, the MAsP web app could be started with the following codes:
```
library(MAsP)
MAsP::MAsPShiny()
```

## Manual
User can download the manual either at the mainpage of MAsP app or at the github directory [MAsP/inst/shiny/MAsP](https://github.com/JunQu-Lab/MAsP/tree/master/inst/shiny/MAsP).
